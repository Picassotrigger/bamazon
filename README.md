This is a very simple inventory / order system. The user is prompted to select the item they want and the number of units. The system will check to see if there is a sufficient quantity in stock. 


If there is, the system will place the order as shown in the graphic below.

Otherwise the system will tell the user that there are not enough units and stop the order.
